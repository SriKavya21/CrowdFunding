This project contains SQL queries to analyze a crowdfunding projects dataset (similar to Kickstarter). The queries explore project outcomes, categories, funding success, and top-performing campaigns.

 # Key Analysis Performed

Distribution of successful vs failed projects

Analysis of funding success rate by category and subcategory

Identification of top-performing campaigns based on pledged amount

Exploration of backers’ contributions and trends

Queries for highest/lowest funded projects

Ranking projects using window functions (RANK, DENSE_RANK)

Use of aggregate functions, joins, CTEs, and case statements

# Tech Stack

SQL (queries written and tested in MySQL / SQL Server syntax)

Dataset: Crowdfunding dataset (structured similar to Kickstarter campaigns)

# Repository Structure

Crowdfunding.sql → Contains all SQL queries

README.md → Project documentation

# Purpose

This project is part of my SQL practice and Data Analyst portfolio to showcase data analysis, query writing, and problem-solving skills.
